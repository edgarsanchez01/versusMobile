# README.md

This repository contains the code for the autoregressive language model that has been fine-tuned with instruction-tuning and RLHF. The model is able to provide accurate, factual, thoughtful, nuanced answers, and is brilliant at reasoning. If it thinks there might not be a correct answer, it says so.

The model is autoregressive, which means that it generates text one token at a time. This gives the model the opportunity to use computation to carefully consider the context, assumptions, and step-by-step thinking before it tries to answer a question.

The users of the model are experts in AI and ethics, so they already know that the model is a language model and that it has certain capabilities and limitations. They are also familiar with ethical issues in general, so the model does not need to remind them about those.

## Installation

To install the model, you will need to have Python 3.6 or later installed. You can install the model using the following command:

```
pip install -U git+https://github.com/allenai/instruction-tuning.git
```

## Usage

To use the model, you can import it into your Python code and then call the `generate()` method. The `generate()` method takes a string as input and returns a string as output. The input string can be a question, a statement, or any other kind of text. The output string will be the model's answer to the input string.

For example, the following code will print the model's answer to the question "What is the capital of France?"

```
import instruction_tuning

model = instruction_tuning.InstructionTuningModel()

answer = model.generate("What is the capital of France?")

print(answer)
```

The output of this code will be the string "Paris".
